        Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds immense potential to revolutionize
        industries across the globe. However, as we move towards an increasingly

    <h2>Why we need AI</h2>
    <p>
      One major reason humans need AI is because it allows us to harness the
      collective intelligence of billions of people. AI learns from large
      amounts of data, which enables it to adapt to new situations and improve
      over time. Additionally, AI can perform complex tasks much faster than
      humans, freeing up valuable time for people to focus on other areas. AI
      can also help enhance human capabilities, such as augmenting our memory or
      even aiding in decision-making processes. Ultimately, AI plays a crucial
      role in shaping the future of technology and the global economy,
      positioning humans to become more innovative and productive in the face of
      unprecedented challenges
